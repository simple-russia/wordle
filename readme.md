<h1>üçá Wordle implementation in Typescript and React</h1>

This project is a TypeScript/React implementation of the popular NYT game "Wordle".
The motivation behind this project is to gain some practical experience of working with TS/Redux Thunk/setting up webpack/working with git.

At the moment it has some raw parts to be fixed in the future (e.g. thunk types).
